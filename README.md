# Data-Analysis-for-Uber-Booking-SQL-And-Power-BI
SQL and Power-Bi Based Data Analysis Project This aims to reflect realistic booking scenarios while maintaining constraints, such as cancellation limits and weekend activity patterns.
# Overview
This project showcases my work on a SQL-based data analysis project for Uber, where I applied SQL queries to address various business and operational challenges. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from a dataset, focusing on booking statuses, ride cancellations, customer and driver ratings, ride distances, and revenue metrics.
# Problem Statement
The project involves analyzing a dataset for Uber rides in Bengaluru for one month. The data includes booking details, vehicle types, locations, ride statuses, cancellations, ratings, and ride distances. The goal is to reflect real-world patterns, ensuring success rates, cancellation limits, and other conditions are met, with increased activity on weekends and weekdays days.
